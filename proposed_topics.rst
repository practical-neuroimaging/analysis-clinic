Topics proposed for future clinics
##################################

* coregistration anatomical version functional : general pipeline best practices?;
  - structural to functional
  - between sessions (not between subjects)
* implement Anova 2nd level / partition variance : a review with SPM / other
  software;
* despiking strategies and software : which one to use?
* connectivity: PPI / beta values
* TMS : difficulties - rationales
* Machine learning : general introduction
* A clinic on [GLM denoising](http://kendrickkay.net/GLMdenoise)
* A spatial normalization artefact with AFNI
