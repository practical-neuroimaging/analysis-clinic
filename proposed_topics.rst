Topics proposed for future clinics
##################################

* Dynamic causal modeling;
* coregistration anatomical version functional : general pipeline best practices?;
  - structural to functional
  - between sessions (not between subjects)
* field map correction : how to do it - what's the effect? / +1
* Evaluation of the design matrix / model : can I check that my model is
  correct ? or not too bad ? 
* What is Cross validation - How do I use it and for what ?
* pros and cons of inclusion of temporal derivative in the GLM design matrix /
  slice timing question;
* implement Anova 2nd level / partition variance : a review with SPM / other
  software;
* despiking strategies and software : which one to use?
* non parametric statistics : an introduction
* connectivity: PPI / beta values 
* TMS : difficulties - rationales
* Machine learning : general introduction
* A clinic on [GLM denoising](http://kendrickkay.net/GLMdenoise)
* A spatial normalization artefact with AFNI
* autonomic changes - hemodynamic vs neural;
* comparing shared variance between models;
* comparing networks across subjects / states;
* how many trials do I need?
